                    Latter-Day Saints website">
                <p>I believe this website displays the principle of visual hierarchy by demonstrating the usage of an
                    F-like pattern right when the site loads, which helps the page flow smoothly. It also displays the
                    grouping of related items in
                    sections, for example the section about the Book of Mormon, which has a header, informative text,
                    and a button to more related information. The grouping of those sections helps the page flow
                    smoothly as well. The colors, typography, and overall design is consistent throughout the landing
                    page as well.</p>

                <p>The Ableton site is a place that's familiar to me, and I thought it would be a good example
                    for
                    usage of white space and clean design.
                    Right from the start, the main part of the lander demonstrates a clean design, along
                    with white space trailing between elements to smoothly guide the user across the site. The usage of
                    white space is less prevalent on mobile views, but I believe that it actually helps keep the design
                    of the site cleaner, by keeping the elements from becoming too small or spread out.

                    alt="A mobile view of the Goergia Farm Bureau mobile landing page">
                <p>The Georgia Farm Bureau landing page demonstrates the usage of repetition by re-using designs like
                    buttons and colors instead of creating a new design for each one, it helps the site maintain design
                    consistency. Upon scrolling down, it reuses the same elements for the Insurance, Member Benefits,
                    and Georgia Neighbors cards, with re-used colors applied to each card, which helps each element
                    stand
                    out but have similar designs. With the same applying to the rest of the page.</p>
